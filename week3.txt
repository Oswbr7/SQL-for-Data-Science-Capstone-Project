Dive Deeper
 I created two tables so i can see the total number of medals in the winter and summer olympics. Thanks to the Pearon correlation, the coefficient between the total 
medals of summer and winter olympics is 0.94 which is positive so we could say that the performance of a country in winter olympics is correlated to taht in summer olympics
and with the standart deviation we caan see that a country performance by year change more in summer games

Go broader

The first relation I missed initially is how the medals fluctuated at the first olympics compared with the last years, this could be due new rules/regulations in the games.
Other connection I missed is how many ahtletes of each genre we have so we could make an analysis of every sport if they have a team of each genre
and with that see the stastics per genre in every team on every sport

My new meatric starts with the hypothesis that in sports like basketball and Futball, if the man team is a really winning team, the Female Team is not necessarily that good
or viceversa

In Basketball, with this code(SELECT NOC AS Team, COUNT(Medal) AS Medals
FROM athlete
WHERE Sport = 'Basketball' and Sex = 'M'
GROUP BY NOC
ORDER BY Medals DESC
LIMIT 20) 
We have that the top 3 teams are USA with 222 medals, URS 110 and YUG 60 but if we see the Female Team let's see if the top 3 remains the same.
In the Female teams the top 3 is USA 119 medals, AUS 60 Medals, URS 36 Medals. So we could see that only USA has a very competitive Team in basketball in both genres 
Now let's see in Football the top 3 teams by each genre 
Brasil 101, URS 87, HUN 79 and for Female Team we have USA 79, GER 68 and CAN 36 
So we could say that in this case, the best teams of each genre are differente so my hypothesis is disproved
